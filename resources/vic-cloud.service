# /factory/cloud has mode 440, which prevents us from reading it as the net user.
# Rather than attempting to remount /factory as rw to add the execute permission,
# we instead just allow vic-cloud to bypass the read-search restriction on dirs.
# We need to fix the permissions in the next Factory OS and can alse re-visit this
# decision post 1.0
